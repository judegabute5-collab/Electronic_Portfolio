  <p>My name is Jude C. Gabute, a 14-year-old student born on November 1, 2010. I consider myself a simple and curious person who enjoys learning new things every day. My favorite foods are sinigang, chocolate cake, and ice cream because they always make me feel comforted and happy. I like the color blue since it gives me a calm and peaceful feeling, and it reminds me of the sky and ocean. During my free time, I love gaming and playing sports, as both help me relax and connect with my friends. I also enjoy listening to “Let Down” by Radiohead because its music helps me reflect and stay focused. Among all my school subjects, Math is my favorite since I enjoy solving problems and finding logical solutions that challenge my thinking skills.</p>

  <p>Most of my closest friends are from outside of school, and they have become an important part of my life. We often hang out after class or during weekends, whether it’s to play basketball, enjoy video games, or just share funny stories. Even though we go to different schools, our friendship stays strong because we always make time to talk and catch up. They are the kind of friends who make me laugh on my worst days and remind me to stay positive when things get tough. Being with them feels easy and natural, and I know I can be myself without pretending to be someone else. Spending time with my friends outside of school helps me unwind, see the brighter side of life, and appreciate the value of true friendship that lasts beyond classrooms and grades.</p>

  <p>My family is the most important part of my life because they guide me in everything I do. They are my source of strength, inspiration, and unconditional love. We enjoy spending time together, sharing stories, and celebrating special occasions as one. Each member of my family has a unique personality, but we all share the same values of respect, care, and understanding. They always remind me to stay humble, responsible, and kind to others. Every time I face challenges, my family supports and encourages me to keep going. Because of them, I have learned the importance of love, unity, and perseverance, which continue to shape who I am and who I want to become.</p>
